# Unreleased

<!--
Add a bullet below in the same commit as any change a Belvedere user would
notice or want -- the test for every line is whether a reader cares. Not what
Belvedere declined, not upstream's version numbers, not About-box or license
housekeeping. Changes that come from a Markdown Preview sync go under a
"### Upstream features included in release" heading. At release,
bin/compose-release-notes.sh builds <version>.md from this file; this comment
and the heading above are dropped. See docs/RELEASE-AUTOMATION.md.

- **Wide tables are readable again.** Since 1.3.0, a table with one long column squeezed the short
  columns to a single letter per line. Short columns now keep their words and the table scrolls
  sideways instead.
